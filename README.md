# 911 Calls Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores US emergency call data to uncover patterns in call types, frequency trends over time, and the distribution of incidents by day of the week and time of year. The analysis was conducted in Python using real-world 911 call records.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `01-911 Calls Data Capstone Project.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook with full analysis and visualizations
- `911.csv` â€“ Preprocessed Kaggle dataset used for analysis

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **EMS (Emergency Medical Services)** was the most common emergency category.
- **Fridays, Mondays, and Tuesdays** saw the highest number of 911 calls.
- **The first three quarters of the year** experienced the largest call volumes.

These insights can help emergency service providers understand peak demand periods and better allocate resources.
